Softwares needed to install- Oracle virtual box , Horton works sandbox with HDP , Tableau.

After the virtual box is installed and Horton works environment is created we have to upload the attached data file into the HDFS 
of Hortonworks and then execute the queries in Hive and Pig which are present in Queries document.  The data file is more than 2GB 
and excel wont support that much amount of data, so we have attached the sample data which we have used. 

Once the queries are run and the output has to be put into the tableau software to visualize the results. Different Tableau graphs
which we have visualized has been attached in the folder.
